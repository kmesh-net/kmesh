              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.

                  Addresses is used to store the internal ip address informatioon on the
                  host. The IP address information is used to generate the IPsec state
                  informatioon. IPsec uses this information to determine which network
                  adapter is used to encrypt and send data.
