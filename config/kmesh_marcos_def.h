 * openEuler-23.03 is an innovative version of openEuler, in the early time, we
 * developed kmesh based on openEuler-23.03, and the implementation of kmesh
 * was related to the openEuler-23.03 kernel. Now, the general implementation
 * of kmesh differs from the previous openEuler-23.03 version, so we need to
 * use this macro to distinguish these differences.
 * The main differences between the general implementation of kmesh and the
 * openEuler-23.03 version are as follows:
 * 1. Use replylong parameter instead of directly modifying the remote IP and Port;
 * 2. Use bpf__strncmp instead of bpf_strncmp for string comparison;
 * 3. Fix Port shift bug on openEuler-23.03.In the kernel network protocol
 *    stack, the port is stored in u16, but in the bpf network module, the port
 *    is stored in u32. Therefore, after the endian conversion, the 16-bit port
 *    needs to be obtained from the 32-bit data structure.
 *    You need to find the position of the valid 16 bits. Generally, after the
 *    port is extended from 16 bits to 32 bits, the port is in the upper 16
 *    bits after the endian conversion. Therefore, you need to offset the port
 *    before using the u16 RX port. In some specific kernels, the port stored
 *    in sockops is in the lower 16 bits and does not need to be offset.
