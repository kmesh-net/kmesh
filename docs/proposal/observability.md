## proposal of Kmesh observability

<!--
This is the title of your KEP. Keep it short, simple, and descriptive. A good
title can help communicate what the KEP is and should be considered as part of
any review.
-->

### Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high-quality, user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.
-->

The importance of observability of service mesh as the basis for manageable, reliable and sustainable grid systems cannot be ignored.In istio, accesslog, metric, and tracing are provided at layers l4 and l7 to meet the user's need for observability.

In this proposal, I will analyse the observability metrics of istio. And propose that Kmesh implement observability features to support these metrics. So that users can seamlessly use Kmesh.

### Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this KEP.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users.
-->

#### Accesslog

In [istio ztunnel](https://github.com/istio/ztunnel?tab=readme-ov-file#logging), the Layer 4 access log contains the following metrics:

source.addr
source.workload
source.namespace
source.identity

destination.addr
destination.hbone_addr
destination.service
destination.workload
destination.namespace
destination.identity

direction

bytes_sent
bytes_recv
duration

An example of the accesslog obtained is shown below:

```console
2024-05-30T12:18:10.172761Z info access connection complete
    src.addr=10.244.0.10:47667 src.workload=sleep-7656cf8794-9v2gv src.namespace=ambient-demo src.identity="spiffe://cluster.local/ns/ambient-demo/sa/sleep" 
    dst.addr=10.244.0.7:8080 dst.hbone_addr=10.244.0.7:8080 dst.service=httpbin.ambient-demo.svc.cluster.local dst.workload=httpbin-86b8ffc5ff-bhvxx dst.namespace=ambient-demo 
    dst.identity="spiffe://cluster.local/ns/ambient-demo/sa/httpbin" 
    direction="inbound" bytes_sent=239 bytes_recv=76 duration="2ms"
```

The accesslog needs to contain the identities(address/workload/namespace/identity) of the destination and source. In addition, the required metrics are the size of the message sent(bytes_sent), the size of the message received(bytes_recv) and the duration of the link.

In order for users to be able to use Kmesh smoothly, Kmesh needs to support these accesslog.

#### Metrics

To monitor service behavior, Istio generates metrics for all service traffic in, out, and within an Istio service mesh. These metrics provide information on behaviors.

Refer to [istio ztunnel metric](https://github.com/istio/ztunnel/blob/6532c553946856b4acc326f3b9ca6cc6abc718d0/src/proxy/metrics.rs#L369) , at Layer L4, the required metric is:

```console
connection_opens: The total number of TCP connections opened
connection_close: The total number of TCP connections closed
received_bytes: The size of total bytes received during request in case of a TCP connection
sent_bytes: The size of total bytes sent during response in case of a TCP connection
on_demand_dns: The total number of requests that used on-demand DNS (unstable)
on_demand_dns_cache_misses: The total number of cache misses for requests on-demand DNS (unstable)
```

DNS-related metrics in the above metrics, as Kmesh does not yet support DNS, we will consider supporting it after the Kmesh DNS functionality is implemented.

Therefore Kmesh first needs to support `connection_opens`, `connection_close`, `received_bytes`, `sent_bytes`.

The above metrics also include the labels shown below:

```console
reporter

source_workload
source_canonical_service
source_canonical_revision
source_workload_namespace
source_principal
source_app
source_version
source_cluster

destination_service
destination_service_namespace
destination_service_name

destination_workload
destination_canonical_service
destination_canonical_revision
destination_workload_namespace
destination_principal
destination_app
destination_version
destination_cluster

request_protocol
response_flag
connection_security_policy

istio_tcp_sent_bytes_total{
    reporter="destination",

    source_workload="sleep",source_canonical_service="sleep",source_canonical_revision="latest",source_workload_namespace="ambient-demo",
    source_principal="spiffe://cluster.local/ns/ambient-demo/sa/sleep",source_app="sleep",source_version="latest",source_cluster="Kubernetes",
    
    destination_service="tcp-echo.ambient-demo.svc.cluster.local",destination_service_namespace="ambient-demo",destination_service_name="tcp-echo",destination_workload="tcp-echo",destination_canonical_service="tcp-echo",destination_canonical_revision="v1",destination_workload_namespace="ambient-demo",
    destination_principal="spiffe://cluster.local/ns/ambient-demo/sa/default",destination_app="tcp-echo",destination_version="v1",destination_cluster="Kubernetes",
    
    request_protocol="tcp",response_flags="-",connection_security_policy="mutual_tls"} 16
```

`Report` shows whether the metric is on the sender or the receiver. Then there is some identity information about the source and destination. These are similar to labels in accesslog.

Then is `request_protocol`, `response_flag` and `connection_security_policy`. The values of `connection_security_policy` are mutual_tls and unknown.

In addition to the metrics already available for istio, as Kmesh is able to get [richer metrics](https://gitee.com/openeuler/gala-docs/blob/master/gopher_tech.md#tcp%E6%8C%87%E6%A0%87) from the kernel. This will be an advantage for Kmesh.

#### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the KEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

It is now clear that in order to enhance the observability of Kmesh, we need to:

- Getting the required metrics from ebpf.
- Generation of accesslog from acquired data
- Support for querying metrics through Prometheus

#### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this KEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

- Dns related indicators.
- Metrics for the L7 layer.

### Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?.
The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

Kmesh needs to collect metrics through the kernel and pass them on to the user mode. In the user mode, accesslog is generated from metrics. And support querying metrics through kemsh localhost:15020.

### Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

This is because Kmesh needs to get metrics from the kernel and sent them to the user mode. We need a bpf map to record the metrics, as a vehicle for transferring.

So we need to define a bpf map that contains all the required metrics:

```console
struct conn_value {
  u64 connection_opens;
  u64 connection_closes;
  u64 received_bytes;
  u64 sent_bytes;
  u64 duration;

  __u32 destination; 
  __u32 source;
};
```

The above destinations and sources are bpf maps that contain workload identity information.

#### Access log

On termination of the TCP link, ebpf sents the data from this link to kmesh-daemon through bpf map.

Relying on this data to generate accesslog, which is then printed by kmesh log.

#### Metrics

Metric is obtained in the same way as accesslog.

After obtaining the metric through bpf map, we also have to support the Prometheus query.

1.Expose metrics to Prometheus RegistryEnable HTTP listening interface.
2.Enable HTTP listening interface.
3.Regular updating of metrics. Update metrics every time a link is broken.

<div align="center">
<img src="pics/observability.svg" width="800" />
</div>

Observability should be achieved in both ads mode and workload mode.

We now consider the realisation of only l4 layers of observability.

For metric features, provide 15020 port for Prometheus queries.

#### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation, and anything particularly
challenging to test, should be called out.

-->

### Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
