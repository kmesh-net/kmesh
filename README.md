## Introduction

Kmesh is a high-performance service mesh data plane software based on programmable kernel. Provides high-performance service communication infrastructure in service mesh scenarios.

## Why Kmesh

### Challenges of the Service Mesh Data Plane

The service mesh software represented by Istio has gradually become popular and has become an important component of cloud infrastructure. However, the current service mesh still face some challenges:

- **Extra latency overhead at the proxy layer**: Single hop service access increases by [2~3ms](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/deployment/performance-and-scalability/#data-plane-performance), which cannot meet the SLA requirements of latency-sensitive applications. Although the community has come up with a variety of data plane solutions to this problem, the overhead introduced by agents cannot be completely reduced.
- **High resources occupation**: The agent occupies extra CPU/MEM overhead, and the deployment density of service container decreases.

### Kmesh：Kernel-native traffic governance

Kmesh innovatively proposes to move traffic governance to the OS, and build a transparent sidecarless service mesh without passing through the proxy layer on the data path.

Note: * Planning

## Quick Start

- prerequisite

  - Currently, Kmesh connects to the Istio control plane. Before starting Kmesh, install the Istio control plane software. For details, see https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#install.
  - The complete Kmesh capability depends on the OS enhancement. Check whether the execution environment is in the [OS list](docs/kmesh_support.md) supported by Kmesh. For other OS environments, see [Kmesh Compilation and Building](docs/kmesh_compile.md).You can also try the [kmesh image in compatibility mode](build/docker/README.md) in other OS environments.For information on various Kmesh images, please refer to the [detailed document](build/docker/README.md).
  
- Docker Images

  Kmesh achieves the ability to completely sink traffic management below the OS through kernel enhancements. When releasing images, the range of OS for which the image is applicable must be considered. To this end, we consider releasing three types of images:

  - Supported OS versions with kernel enhancement modifications

    The current [openEuler 23.03](https://repo.openeuler.org/openEuler-23.03/) OS natively supports the kernel enhancement features required by Kmesh. Kmesh release images can be directly installed and run on this OS. For a detailed list of supported OS versions with kernel enhancement modifications, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/kmesh-net/kmesh/blob/main/docs/kmesh_support.md).
  
  - For all OS versions:

    To be compatible with different OS versions, Kmesh provides online compilation and running images. After Kmesh is deployed, it will automatically select Kmesh features supported by the host machine's kernel capabilities, to meet the demand for one image to run in different OS environments.
    
    
    
    Considering the universality of kmesh, we have released an image for compiling and building kmesh. Users can conveniently create a kmesh image based on this, which can run on their current OS version. By default, it is named `ghcr.io/kmesh-net/kmesh:latest`, but the user can adjust it as needed. Please refer to [Kmesh Build Compilation](docs/kmesh_compile.md#build docker image) for more details.
    
    
    ```bash
    make docker TAG=latest
    ```
  
- Start Kmesh

  - Install from Helm
  
  ```sh
  [root@ ~]# helm install kmesh ./deploy/helm -n kmesh-system --create-namespace
  ```

  - Install from Yaml

  ```sh
  # get kmesh.yaml from deploy/yaml/kmesh.yaml
  [root@ ~]# kubectl apply -f kmesh.yaml
  [root@ ~]# kubectl apply -f clusterrole.yaml
  [root@ ~]# kubectl apply -f clusterrolebinding.yaml
  [root@ ~]# kubectl apply -f serviceaccount.yaml
  [root@ ~]# kubectl apply -f l7-envoyfilter.yaml
  ```
  
  By default, the Kmesh base function is used, other function can be selected by adjusting the startup parameters in the yaml file.
  
- Check kmesh service status

  ```sh
  [root@ ~]# kubectl get pods -A | grep kmesh
  kmesh-system   kmesh-l5z2j                                 1/1     Running   0          117m
  ```

- View the running status of kmesh service

  ```sh
  [root@master mod]# kubectl logs -f -n kmesh-system kmesh-l5z2j
  time="2024-02-19T10:16:52Z" level=info msg="service node sidecar~192.168.11.53~kmesh-system.kmesh-system~kmesh-system.svc.cluster.local connect to discovery address istiod.istio-system.svc:15012" subsys=controller/envoy

  ```
  
  More compilation methods of Kmesh, See: [Kmesh Compilation and Construction](docs/kmesh_compile.md)

- Kmesh L7

  - Install waypoint

    ```
    [root@ ~]# istioctl x waypoint apply --service-account default
    [root@ ~]# kubectl get pods
    NAME                                      READY   STATUS         RESTARTS        AGE
    default-istio-waypoint-6d9df77746-njjq5   1/1     Running        0               10s
    nginx-55b99db5d6-ddpb2                    1/1     Running        0               10d
    sleep-865b99bb57-qzjcj                    1/1     Running        0               10d
    ```
  
  - Replace the waypoint image with the kmesh customized image.

    ```
    [root@ ~]# kubectl get gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io
    NAME      CLASS            ADDRESS         PROGRAMMED   AGE
    default   istio-waypoint   10.96.143.232   True         5m7s
    ```

    Add annotation "sidecar.istio.io/proxyImage: ghcr.io/kmesh-net/waypoint:v0.3.0" to the `default` gateway. Then gateway pod will
    restart. Now kmesh is L7 enabled!
